\usage{
tmap_animation(
  tm,
  filename = "animation.gif",
  width = NA,
  height = NA,
  dpi = NA,
  delay = 40,
  loop = TRUE,
  restart.delay = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tm}{tmap object. In order to create a series of tmap plots, which will be the frames of the animation, it is important to set nrow and ncol in \code{\link{tm_facets}}, for otherwise a small multiples plot is generated. Commonly, where one map is shown at a time, both nrow and ncol are set to 1.}

\item{filename}{filename of the video (should be a .gif or .mpg file)}

\item{width}{width of the animation file (in pixels)}

\item{height}{height of the animation file (in pixels)}

\item{dpi}{dots per inch. Only applicable for raster graphics. By default 300, but this can be set with the option \code{output.dpi} in \code{\link{tmap_options}}.}

\item{delay}{delay time between images (in 1/100th of a second)}

\item{loop}{logical that determined whether the animation is looped, or an integer value that determines how many times the animation is looped.}

\item{restart.delay}{delay time between the loops (in 1/100th of a second)}
}
\description{
Create a gif or mpeg animation from a tmap plot. The free tool ImageMagick is required.
}
\note{
Not only tmap plots are supported, but any series of R plots.
